# CCHSAssassins
This project was created witha friend in our senior year of high school to organize the annual game of assissins with our grade. The website was provided all the information a player needed to play the game and allowed them to register when they eliminated their target, so that they automaticaly were sent their new target. The backend of this project was created by my friend who managed the list of assassins and their targets on a AWS server. This project is hosted on google's firebase.

The site is still available through the firbase hosting link (https://assasins-a9bac.web.app/), however, I did not renew the cchsassassin.com domain so that no longer works.

This was definitly one of my favorite projects that I've done, as it was the first time I created something that was actually used by 100+ people. It was defintly interesting managing the game and dealing with issues as they came up.
