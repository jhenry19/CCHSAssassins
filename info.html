                <div class="info-text">Assassins is a longstanding tradition for the seniors at CCHS. The premise is simple: eliminate your assigned target by squirting them with water. Below is an explanation on how to use the website but not a complete explanation of the rules. For the offical rules, look on the Assassins facebook page.</div>

                <div class="info-text">When you have successfully eliminated your target and all parties involved are in agreement that it was a valid assassination in acordance to the official game rules, your target must provide you with their player ID. This is a unique number which each player can find when logged into the site. Log into your account and input the player's id into the box provided. Click submit and refresh the page. Your target will automatically be reassaigned and displayed.</div>

You can find this unique id number when you log into the account. It's important to note that giving the player id to your target is agreeing that they have successfully eliminated you. This can not be undone so if there is a dispute, do not give the player your id.</div>

In the event of a disagreement with either your target or your assassin, please abide by the following procedure: </div>
                <ul style="list-style-type: square">
                    <li>Talk to the opposing party to review the events that occurred leading up to and including the assassination. It is helpful if either partie has impartial witnesses to provide their account of the assassination</li>
                    <li>Identify area(s) of discrepancy and attempt to resolve the dispute in a calm and respectful manner
                    </li>
                    <li>If no resolution can be found between the two parties, BOTH should contact Julian Henry AND Amos Decker (text or facebook message us) and provide a summary of the discrepancy. THIS SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT. If you know you are wrong you should concede before resorting to contacting Julian and Amos.
                    </li>
                    <li>The game officials will review the accounts and do any necessary investigation before issuing their verdict. This verdict is final and there is no appeals process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="info-text">NOTE: If you and your target report a disagreement and the game officials find that you broke the rules during your assassination, you will be removed from the game. This is why you should only attempt legal assassination and in the event that you commit an assassination illegally, admit it to your target and stay in the game rather than letting the dispute reach the game officials and get removed from the game.</div>
